	abstract = {Cocoa plantation is a major land-use system that influences the functional structure of the forest landscape in Ghana. As a key driver of forest landscape dynamics, there is no adequate existing information on the nature, extent and magnitude of land-use change associated with cocoa expansion into forests. Therefore, we have studied the land-use transitions and intensities by using image-fusion on vegetation indices (VI) and a digital elevation model (DEM) to detect and distinguish cocoa plantation from the forest and other vegetation types. This was followed by intensity analysis based on historical land-use changes. With the VI-DEM image, we mapped out different cocoa plantations from the forest and other vegetations with a higher degree of success. The land-use categories were clustered into five main types (closed forest, open-forest, cocoa, lands-in-transition and settlement) to evaluate the transition and intensities from 1986 to 2015. The results showed two main transition patterns, namely 1) the conversion of forest to settlement and cocoa plantation; 2) the conversion of closed forests to open forest, due to logging and conversion of cocoa plantation to lands-in-transition (LIT). The intensity analysis further revealed that expansion in cocoa plantation instead targets least resisted open-forest and LIT areas with an isolated localised fragment of the fringes of forest reserves. Generally, the study revealed that the VI-DEM image-fusion technique is effective for detecting and isolating cocoa plantations, forest and other land-uses with high accuracy. Estimation of cocoa-led deforestation improved after isolating cocoa plantations. Cocoa expansions target more often open-forest and lands-in-transition than closed-forest. When cocoa expansion occurs in closed-forest, it is episodic, localised and coincides with the early stage of the boom-bust pattern.},

	abstract = {Globally, forest reserves are threatened by human induced deforestation and forest degradation. Within the Congo Basin, substantial deforestation has been quantified over the past years following the recent advancement in remote sensing and GIS applications in forestry research. Satellite images and ground based data are used to map deforestation, forest degradation and disturbances and their corresponding drivers. In Cameroon, recent studies show a general increase in deforestation over the past years. In most forest reserves of the Western Highlands, forest cover loss is basically as a result of rising population of in-situ and nearby settled communities. The Metchie-Ngoum Protection Forest Reserve (PFR) is but one. The study evaluates forest cover changes in the Metchie-Ngoum PFR using remote sensing and ground observations. It was revealed that forest cover though remained relatively stable over the study period (1984–2015), witnessed much degradation resulting to 36.11\% estimated secondary forest cover by 1984. Secondary forest also experienced a cumulative loss to clearings/farms and built-up area from 1984 to 2000. The year 2000 was the most alarming. Forest loss is linked to oil palm expansion, increase population and built-up area and settlement related activities like logging. Faced with such rising threat on forest reserves, only a concerted action can guide sustainable forest management and conservation. The study thus recommends the design and implementation of a guided forest conservation policy which gradually applies proper sensitization, frequent visits by eco-guards, less intimidation, participatory forest mapping and the incorporation of forest communities in the sustainable management of forest reserves.},

Three remote sensing datasets (Landsat optical data, ALOS L-band data and LiDAR derived Canopy Height Model (CHM)) were used in conjunction with three different machine learning (ML) regression techniques (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)). These ML methods were implemented on (a) Landsat spectral data, (b) Landsat spectral band \& ALOS backscatter data, and (c) Landsat spectral band, ALOS backscatter data, \& LiDAR CHM data. The Landsat-ALOS combination produced more accurate classification results (95\% overall accuracy with SVM) compared to Landsat-only bands for all ML models. Inclusion of LiDAR CHM (which is a proxy for vertical canopy heights) improved the overall accuracy to 98\%. The research establishes that majority of PKNP is dominated by cashew plantations and the nearly intact forests are concentrated in the more inaccessible parts of the park. The findings demonstrate how different RS datasets can be used in conjunction with different ML models to map forests that had undergone varying levels of degradation and plantations.},

To achieve this, the land cover of this protected area was determined by classifying satellite images obtained before, during and after the conflicts, and via ground surveys. Metrics of landscape ecology were calculated. A ground campaign for observing the CFHS’s flora and damages incurred was carried out using a sampling of eighteen 500 m-long transects. The results show that forest fragmentation intensified during and after the period of conflicts. Forests covered over 93\% of the CFHS’s area before conflicts and under 28\% in 2015. The main cause of this deforestation is cacao growing. Anthropic activities caused the loss of 40\% of plant species, including some which are endemic in Ivory Coast.},

	abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) have been frequently shown to result in more accurate classification than other image classification methods. However, few studies have successfully quantified their performance for mapping oil palm plantations. Various sustainability criteria developed by the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) have a spatial component but they provide little guidance on mapping oil-palm-related cover changes. SVM and maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) classification approaches in classifying oil palm plantations with Landsat ETM+ were compared. The best combination of three bands from the satellite image was selected based on Bhattacharyya distance. SVM and MLC performance was evaluated using overall accuracy assessment and kappa statistics. Bands 4, 5, and 3 provided the best spectral separability indices based on Bhattacharyya distance. SVM classification resulted in an overall accuracy of 78.3\% (kappa statistic 0.73) compared with MLC, with an overall accuracy of 71.9\% (kappa statistic 0.65). The performance of the SVM method is mainly affected by the accurate setting of parameters involved in the algorithm. The radial basis function parameter setting in SVM was an important variable in the classification process, and SVM improved the classification of oil palm mapping. Although the classification accuracy is still insufficient for large-scale implementation of the technique, further refinements may provide a way forward towards producing baseline information useful for RSPO certification.},

	abstract = {Côte d'Ivoire is the world's leading cocoa producer, annually generating over 1,500,000 metric tons of Theobroma cacao beans. Growth of this agri-business has led to extensive deforestation in Côte d'Ivoire, where the majority of the country's forest (excluding that in Tai National Park) exists as small, fragmented forest islands. Most of these forest blocks are designated as national parks or forest reserves, i.e., protected areas (PAs), but wildlife within Côte d'Ivoire's PAs is increasingly threatened by two illegal activities: hunting and full sun cocoa farming. In this paper, we investigate the impact of cocoa production on primate populations inside protected areas. We surveyed twenty three PAs (5 national parks, 18 forest reserves) in Côte d'Ivoire to determine (1) the number of primate taxa present, (2) the number of human inhabitants living adjacent to or within each PA, (3) the extent of overall habitat degradation, and (4) the extent of habitat degradation due to cocoa farming. Our data reveal a significant positive correlation (r2 = .736, p {\textless} .01, α = 0.01) between cocoa farming and the absence of primate species inside Côte d'Ivoire's national parks and forest reserves. Thirteen of 23 protected areas surveyed have lost all primate populations, and four taxa - Colobus vellerosus (white-thighed black and white colobus), Colobus polykomos (Western black and white colobus), Procolobus badius waldroni (Miss Waldron's red colobus) and Procolobus badius badius (Bay colobus) – were not found in any PAs we visited. Aggressive conservation action is needed to curb hunting throughout Côte d'Ivoire, but unless illegal cocoa farming is similarly controlled, even effective enforcement of anti-hunting laws will not prevent the loss of additional primate diversity, since habitats capable of supporting primate populations – including those within protected areas - will no longer exist.},

	abstract = {The biodiversity of West African rainforests is globally significant but poorly described, little understood in terms of its functional significance, and under threat from forest loss and degradation. Estimates suggest that about 10 million ha of forest may have been lost in the 20th Century, and around 80\% of the original forest area is now an agriculture-forest mosaic. These highly modified forests provide food, fuel, fibre and a range of ecosystem services for over 200 million people. As a consequence, the future of biodiversity in the region is intimately linked with the lives and livelihoods of local people. The available evidence suggests that forest loss and degradation has been caused primarily by agricultural expansion, sometimes facilitated by other human activities such as wood extraction. This expansion is a response to the demand generated by a growing and increasingly urbanised human population, but has been exacerbated by small increases in crop yields over recent decades. We synthesize and review our state of knowledge on the value of human-modified habitats for forest biodiversity in the region. Data on biodiversity are patchy, but we show that across plant, invertebrate and vertebrate groups, there is a significant loss of forest species as tree cover is reduced and vegetation structure simplified. Agricultural expansion clearly causes significant local biodiversity loss. We argue that replicated landscape-scale studies are now needed that describe changes across a range of biodiversity groups (above and below ground) in relation to land-use and landscape context to address knowledge gaps and biases. Such descriptive studies need to be complemented by a deeper understanding of the causes of species turnover patterns, together with work on the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem function and services. Biodiversity conservation in the region is becoming increasingly embedded within a more multi-functional view of agriculture-forest mosaics that attempts to recognise and value the range of services provided by tree cover and other land-uses. This relatively new perspective has the potential, at least in principle, to re-shape the drivers of land-use change because tree cover can generate additional revenue through carbon trading or certification schemes. It will become clearer over the coming decades whether this potential can be realised, but the implications for biodiversity conservation in the region are potentially profound. The socio-economic processes that have driven forest loss and degradation in West Africa are having an increasing impact on the relatively undisturbed rainforest of the Congo Basin. We conclude by pointing out that while West African forest landscapes are a potent reminder of what might happen in Central Africa in the near future, they also provide insights for developing policies and practice that might avoid comparable levels of forest loss and degradation.},

	abstract = {The UTZ Certified Cocoa program is a program for sustainable farming. The program aims to improve crop growth, farmer income, to protect environment, and to secure sustainable supply through good agricultural practices. Cocoa is the main cash crops in Ivory Coast. It is mainly produced by small farmers in a rather extensive way. In order to produce Cocoa in sustainable way without effecting the surrounding environment especially forests, UTZ has been working with farmers and encouraging them to comply with its code of conduct where UTZ only certifies the cocoa that comes from farms complies with its code of conduct. For example the Cocoa farm should not be exist within 15 m distance from big water bodies or within protected area and its 2000 meter buffer zone. UTZ also encourages farmer to maintain the minimum number of shade trees in his farms, which should not be less than 12 tree per hectare in order to mitigate the effect of global warming on coca tree. In order to be able to detect any non-compliance with its code of conduct, UTZ has recently tried to explore the possibility of using remote sensing in detecting non-compliance for some control points of its code of conduct. We were lucky in getting a support from European Space agency (ESA) through EOhops project where they gave us credits to be able to buy, process and analyze high resolution satellite imagery (Kompast- 3 with 1m resolution).Beside this remote sensing data, we collected some information about the status of the farm from farmers by interview, and we were also able to fly a drone over some areas for ground truth. We used supported vector machine (SVM) to create land cover map for our study area depending on the previous inputs. The resulted map enabled UTZ to identify some forest that open source data were not able to identify (protected planet). UTZ was able to estimate the number of shade trees per plots and also to estimate the production of each plot kg cocoa per year and to compare it with what the farmer said during the survey about the number of shade trees and his cocoa production. The results shows that all the cocoa farms were certified by UTZ in our study area is not grown in forest or within protected areas or its 2000 m buffer zone. No farm located within 15 meter from water body. The correlation between the numbers of shade trees that was estimated by remote sensing with what the farmer had said during the survey was high (r2= 8.8). Land cover maps shows that cocoa is the main cash crop in our study area. The correlation between the estimated coca productions by remote sensing with what the farmer had said was good (r2=7.6). In sum, satellite imagery can play a crucial role in improving certification process and its transparency and efficiency. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}},

There is a certain cause and effect relationship between changing practice for development and land use change, thus necessitating an assessment of land use dynamics and the projection trend. A combination of geospatial and remote techniques were utilized to evaluate the present and future landuse/ landcover scenario of southern part of the Western Region of Ghana. Multi-temporal satellite imageries of the Landsat series and DMC were used to map the changes in land use from 1990 to 2010. Four major land use classes (Forest, Agriculture, Built-up and water) were considered as the most dynamic land cover/use (LULC) practice. Markov modelling was applied for prediction of probable land use/ land cover change scenario for the years 2020, 2030 and 2040. The study showed that in years 2020 to 2040 in the predictable future, there will be a gradual increase in built up areas, while a stability in agricultural land use is envisaged. Agricultural land use would still remain the dominant land use type. Forests would be drastically reduced from close to 87\% in 1990 to just fewer than 20\% in 2040. This precarious situation would demand that prudent land use decisions to be made to keep Ghana’s REDD+ program on track and to mitigate the effects of the climate change phenomenon.},
